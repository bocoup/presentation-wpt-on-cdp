The goal of this experiment:

    wptrunner <--------------------- CDP ---------------------------> Chrome

## Finding a library

Chrome Debugger Protocol bindings:

- [chromewhip](https://github.com/chuckus/chromewhip)
- [PyChromeDevTools](https://github.com/marty90/PyChromeDevTools)
- [pychrome](https://github.com/fate0/pychrome)

WPT's constraints:

- Operating systems: GNU/Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Platform: Python 2
- License: [BSD
  3-clause](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/5acd3bcf6609691afc493aed8cb4446e8dc796ee/LICENSE.md)
  compatible
- functional integration with the WebSocket protocol supported by
  Chromium/Chrome (e.g. version and protocol extensions)

???

As of October 2018 (when research and development began), none of the libraries
satisfied the constraints.

---

## Finding a library

Generic WebSocket clients implementations:

- [Lomond](https://pypi.org/project/lomond/)
- [pywebsocket](https://github.com/google/pywebsocket) - "pywebsocket is
  intended for testing or experimental purposes."
- [wspy](https://github.com/taddeus/wspy) - client too primitive to interface
  with Chrome
- [WebSock](https://pypi.org/project/websock/) - does not expose a client
  abstraction
- [gevent-websocket](https://pypi.org/project/gevent-websocket/) - Last
  released: Mar 12, 2017
- [ws4py](https://github.com/Lawouach/WebSocket-for-Python) - unmaintained
- [Autobahn](https://crossbar.io/autobahn/#python) &
  [Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/) (Autobahn also integrates with
  [asyncio](http://docs.python.org/3.4/library/asyncio.html))
- [websockets](https://pypi.org/project/websockets/) - requires Python 3
- [websocket-client](https://pypi.org/project/websocket-client/) - LGPL licensed
- [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/)

???

In the Python ecosystem, WebSocket *server* implementations abound. Clients are
harder to come by.

## Finding a library

Generic WebSocket clients implementations satisfying WPT's constraints:

- [Lomond](https://pypi.org/project/lomond/)
- [gevent-websocket](https://pypi.org/project/gevent-websocket/)
- [ws4py](https://github.com/Lawouach/WebSocket-for-Python)
- [Autobahn](https://crossbar.io/autobahn/#python) &
  [Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/)

Subjective priorities:

- probability of support/maintenance
- number and size of dependencies

Initial experimentation: https://github.com/bocoup/wpt-cdp-experiment

Winner: [Lomond](https://pypi.org/project/lomond/)

## Finding a library

> Polling
>
> Lomond checks for automatic pings and performs other housekeeping tasks at a
> regular intervals. This *polling* is exposed as `Poll` events. Your
> application can use these events to do any processing that needs to be
> invoked at regular intervals.
>
> The default poll rate of 5 seconds is granular enough for Lomond’s polling
> needs, while having negligible impact on CPU. If your application needs to

>
> **Note** If your application needs to be more realtime than polling once a

https://lomond.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide.html#polling

???

Lomond uses a polling-based approach by design, making it less efficient than a
typical WebSocket client.

---

## Finding a library

Runner-up: [wspy](https://github.com/taddeus/wspy)

> wspy is a standalone implementation of web sockets for Python, defined by RFC 6455.
> The incentive for creating this library is the absence of a layered
> implementation of web sockets outside the scope of web servers such as Apache
> or Nginx. wspy does not require any third-party programs or libraries outside
> Python's standard library. It provides low-level access to sockets, as well
> as high-level functionalities to easily set up a web server. Thus, it is both
> suited for quick server programming, as well as for more demanding
> applications that require low-level control over each frame being
> sent/received.

https://github.com/taddeus/wspy

???

The `wspy` library was disqualified because it doesn't support [the per-message
deflate WebSocket extension](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7692).

---

## API stability

Ideal:

    wptrunner <-- WebDriver --> Chromedriver <-------- CDP ---------> Chrome

    wptrunner <--------------------- CDP ---------------------------> Chrome

???

The goal of this project was to remove Chromedriver and use CDP in its place.
From that perspective, it was encouraging to know that Chromedriver is itself
implemented in CDP. That made the task seem much more like eliminating a
middleman.

--

 Actual target:

                                               .--- stable CDP ---.
    wptrunner <-- WebDriver --> Chromedriver <-+ experimental CDP +-> Chrome
                                               '- deprecated CDP -'

    wptrunner <----------------- stable CDP ------------------------> Chrome

???

The reality is a little more nuanced, though. When it comes to coordinating
with changes to the Chrome DevTools Protocol, the Chromedriver maintainers have
an advantage on WPT. This affords them more confidence in their use of APIs
that are labeled "experimental" or "deprecated" for public consumption.

I tried to rely on the stable API alone, but I wasn't always successful. I'll
say more about that shortly.

Chrome DevTools Protocol: `Page.`**`navigate`**

> Navigates current page to the given URL.

[source](https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/tot/Page#method-navigate) (retrieved 2018-12-10)

???

From the description, you might expect that after sending this command and
receiving a response, the navigation operation would be complete. That's what I
expected, anyway.

That's actually not the case, which is why the comparison isn't completely
fair. CDP allows for inspection into many parts of navigation. In fact, it
*requires* it.

???

This is a change to a script which wptrunner injects into the document. Today,
it does that using WebDriver, and everything works as expected.

In my initial implementation, navigation was occurring far earlier than I
expected. This change allows the script to be injected prior to the window's
`load` event. (It appears to support this already, but the mechanism it uses
invalidates all tests which set a handler via the document's `<body>` element.)

---

```diff
-var root = document.documentElement;
-var observer = new MutationObserver(root_wait);

+  }
+  observer = new MutationObserver(root_wait);
+
+  observer.observe(root, {attributes: true});
+
+  root_wait();
+}());
```

???

Shortly after, I found that the script was executing even sooner than *that*.
Tests were failing intermittently because the `document.documentElement` was
not defined.

I actually applied this patch and ran the tests before thinking that maybe I
was doing something wrong.

---

## Semantics

Chrome DevTools Protocol: Navigation-related events

`Page.`**`domContentEventFired`**

`Page.`**`frameScheduledNavigation`** - Fired when frame schedules a potential
navigation.

`Page.`**`frameStartedLoading`** - Fired when frame has started loading.

`Page.`**`frameStoppedLoading`** - Fired when frame has stopped loading.

`Page.`**`lifecycleEvent`** - Fired for top level page lifecycle events such as
navigation, load, paint, etc.

`Page.`**`loadEventFired`**

`Page.`**`navigatedWithinDocument`** - Fired when same-document navigation
happens, e.g. due to history API usage or anchor navigation.

???

Chrome DevTools Protocol also defines a bunch of "events," many of which are
relevant to navigation.

To correctly implement the common case of "go to this URL and let me know if
anything goes wrong," one must identify the "active frame," register for many
events fired from that frame, initiate navigation, and wait for an event for
some duration before giving up and reporting the operation as "timed out." This
was what I attempted to implement for this experiment, but I almost certainly
got it wrong.

In WebDriver, all of this is modeled with a single HTTP request.

Chrome DevTools is certainly more powerful, but this comes at the cost of
complexity. Although it might be possible to improve test precision with some
of this functionality, I'd be leery of relying on the timing of messages on a
WebSocket channel.

For WPT, I would recommend using a library.

This is also a very indirect way to document a protocol. Even with the explicit
naming of these events, the precise semantics probably aren't clear enough to
support interoperability.

## Architecture overview

Concepts

- browser - web browser process which runs a WebSocket server that implements
  the Chrome Debugger Protocol; this process is managed by the user of
  Pyppeteer
- `pyppeteer.Connection` - abstraction around a WebSocket connection to a
  running browser process
- `pyppeteer.Session` - interface for interacting with a browser window

```
                    .---------------- Pyppeteer ---------------.
    .---------.     |     .------------.           .---------. |
    | browser | 1 <---> * | Connection | * <---> 1 | Session | |
    '---------'     |     '------------'           '---------' |
                    '------------------------------------------'

## API usage

    $ grep -Ehro 'API status:.*' tools/pyppeteer/pyppeteer | sort | uniq -c
          3 API status: deprecated
          5 API status: experimental
         28 API status: stable

???

Each CDP method and event reference in the source code is labeled with a note
on the API status at the time of writing. As mentioned earlier, I was mostly
able to stick to the stable API. One piece of functionality could be
implemented with either a deprecated API or an experimental API, so I used both
and exposed runtime a flag to control which is used.

## Settings

All trials:

- Used [WPT at commit
  `8eab58f51c93f0075f4cc5e8e6d5b4fb2c4c4919`](8eab58f51c93f0075f4cc5e8e6d5b4fb2c4c4919)
  - Date: 2018-12-10
  - Total tests: 31,101
- Used the `wpt-docker-worker` (only available from tasks initiated from the
  web-platform-tests/wpt repository)
- Did not restart after unexpected test results

---

## Discrepancies

`master` to CDP:

- 361 tests with differing statuses
- 35 tests with differing subtest results

    (361 + 35) / 31101 => 1.27% discrepancy in patch

???

Surprisingly, the results of the CDP-powered versoin of wptrunner did not
completely align with those in `master`.

--

`master` to itself:

- 21 tests with differing statuses
- 9 tests with differing subtest results

    (21 + 9) / 31101 => 0.10% discrepancy due to flakiness

???

A small portion of those can be explained by existing flakiness in the tests.
If anyone's bored, I've included a list of the flaky tests in the appendix.

--

`revert-gh-13419` ([gh-13419](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/13419)) to CDP:

- 64 tests with differing statuses
- 32 tests with differing subtest results

    (64 + 32) / 31101 => 0.31% discrepancy in patch (adjusted)

???

An infrastructure patch merged in October introduced a number of regressions.
Many of the discrepancies identified above are unintentional fixes to those
regressions. If we compare the results to a version of `master` where that
patch is reverted, we get a clearer picture of undesirable differences.

Further research is needed to determine the source of these discrepancies. I
suspect it's due to other oversimplifications in my use of the protocol.

---

## Duration

`master`:

- Testharness: 17.88 minutes (&sigma; = 8.11)
- Reftest: 12.16 minutes (&sigma; = 5.29)

`revert-gh-13419` ([gh-13419](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/13419)):

- Testharness: 12.07 minutes (&sigma; = 4.33)
- Reftest: 11.63 minutes (&sigma; = 4.90)

CDP:

- Testharness: 12.65 minutes (&sigma; = 4.58)
- Reftest: 7.81 minutes (&sigma; = 3.47)

???

These are the average durations needed to run a "chunk" of each test type.

The current implementation appears to be faster at running reftests, but
remember it is built on a WebSocket library that uses a polling strategy. These
numebrs may change with the use of another WebSocket library.

## Future work

Contribute support for [the per-message deflate WebSocket
extension](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7692) to `wspy`; switch to `wspy`

- More efficient use of transport -- potentially faster and more stable
- Small time/effort investment (presumably)

---

![issue report for the wspy project](img/wspy-issue.png)

???

This would involve contributing a feature to `wspy`. That would have the added
benefit of helping [@jiagangzhang](https://github.com/jiagangzhang).

---

## Future work

Migrate wptrunner to Python 3 and build on top of a more ergonomic library.

???

Python 3 compatibility has been discussed before because it would be beneficial
for a number of other reasons.

---

![A list of pull requests concerning Python 3 support](img/python-3-pull-requests.png)

???

This effort is already underway as a pet project by long-time WPT contributor
[@Ms2ger](https://github.com/ms2ger)

---

## Future work

Work with Chrome DevTools maintainers to nail down the semantics of the most
stable methods.

---

## Summary

Experiment a success!

- Proved concept
- Suggested potential improvement in efficiency (decreased time-to-results)
- Rough edges with tractable path to resolution (~100 tests invalidated)
- Identified risk for production use: complexity and stability (could be
  mitigated through the use of a CDP-aware library)
